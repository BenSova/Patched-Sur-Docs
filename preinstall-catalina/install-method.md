# Install Method

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-10-17-at-3.32.17-pm.png)

This install method you choose defines whether or not you want to reset macOS back to its default state, without keeping your data, or just update the OS version to a newer macOS version. A clean install completely wipes your drive, then reinstalls macOS so you can run the setup process again. An update just updates macOS to the latest version.
