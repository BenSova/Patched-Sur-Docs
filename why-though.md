# Why Though?

The answer here is simple. There are two big reasons, because we can, and because these Macs can survive for a lot longer than Apple says. 

Here's a big one for those of you looking at M1 Macs, **Apple Silicon is new, and is in its first generation, imagine what the next M Series Chip could be.** The Apple Silicon Macs are really good right now but do have some flaws, like the lack of ports. In a couple of months, this could change dramatically, possibly with a lot more things that we've wanted for a long time. Don't take my word as 100% true, but simply waiting is fine given the chance of improvements and what they could be.

Either way though, these Macs still are powerful, even on the latest version of macOS, which sometimes might make them faster. I personally have been developing Patched Sur on my Mid-2012 Mac that's running Big Sur. Xcode seems super fast and snappy \(most of the time\), even with my complex app. Some people with supported Macs say that Xcode is slow all the time with basic apps. Think about that for a moment.

Okay, but our Macs would be better off on Catalina... right? Well, that I can't give a yes or no answer to, however, I can give my experience. A while ago, I installed Catalina on a separate volume on my Mac to try it out after having Big Sur for months. It was noticeably slower on Catalina. Oh yeah, and Big Sur ruined my perspective on the old UI design and macOS Catalina actually looks ugly now, which is kind of sad and weird because I thought it was great a year ago.

It is completely up to you, but it is worth considering on 2012/2013 Macs.
